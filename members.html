			Tom Love Innovation Hub at OU: Building and Programming

		<p> <b> We've met many people at the weekly hack and learn/ free code camp sessions once a week at the Tom Love
				Innovation Hub at OU ever since we've been going there since late May and many people have been able to give us
				programming advice. Not only does the Hub have programming advice, but they also have build/engineering advice and
				equipment for us to use. The students at OU sometimes have some interesting engineering designs they toss out to us
				as they see us working and the Hub has a lot of useful equipment such as 3D Printers. Without the Hub, we wouldn't
				have any 3D printed parts on our robot.</b> </p>
